# Introduction

## Motivation

The concept of Electromagnetics sounds fascinating because it deals with things we see in our daily lives and try to explain the science behind them. But it might seem intimidating also because of the complex big equations and huge calculations to attain a solution and most of the things like fields and vectors which are not familiar in our daily life might be difficult to visualize.

Many problems in electromagnetics involve a regular geometry and are defined by simple vector equations. However, for such problems, the analytical computation of the vector electromagnetic fields in 3D space become complicated, involving spherical and cylindrical harmonic solutions and special functions such asHankle and Besselâ€™s functions. For example, the electric field vector in a 3D space due to the combined effect of multiple charge particles becomes difficult to represent analytically. 

> The goal of this project is to simplify the handling of vectors and numerical computation of vector operations in 3D space, we propose to develop a Python library for vector operations and vector calculus.
